            Asar is an original Devanagari and Latin typeface that is based on 
            an expanding brush stroke following a heart line. 
            The design is meant to work well with long texts while maintaining a certain charm at large sizes. 
            Asar is partially derived from Pria Ravichadran's Palanquin, starting by interpreting that design's overall proportions and heart lines 
            and glyph set and OpenType features.

            Cardo is a large Unicode font specifically designed for the needs of classicists, 
            Biblical scholars, medievalists, and linguists. 
            It also works well for general typesetting in situations where a high-quality 
            Old Style font is appropriate. Its large character set supports many modern languages as well as those needed by scholars. 
            Cardo also contains features that are required for high-quality typography such as ligatures, text figures 
            (also known as old style numerals), true small capitals and a variety of punctuation and space characters.

            The Monda font family is a libre font family. It has been designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.
            Monda language support includes now African Latin and full coverage of Vietnamese, additional to all Western, Central, and South-Eastern European languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Syncopate was designed in 2010 as a headline and display typeface.

            Light in weight with a wide body width, it is a unicase design where the traditional lowercase x-height 
            has been abandoned and a single uppercase height rules the design of all of the alpha and numeric glyphs. 
            Some uppercase glyphs are copied to their lowercase slots, where other lowercase glyphs such as the a, e, and r, are scaled up to uppercase heights. 
            This motif allows for a vast array of setting possibilities.

            Arvo is a geometric slab-serif typeface family suited for screen and
            print. The family includes 4 cuts: Roman, Italic, Roman Bold, Bold
            Italic. It is a libre font, first published in Google Fonts. The
            flavour of the font is rather mixed. It's monolinear-ish, but has a
            tiny bit of contrast (which increases the legibility a little in Mac
            OS X.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Lato is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010
            by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic (“Lato” means “Summer” in
            Polish). In December 2010 the Lato family was published under the
            Open Font License by his foundry tyPoland, with support from Google.
